# App Overview

<!-- theme: info -->
> This section is intended for developers building an app with PagerDuty. For information on how to add or remove an existing app on your PagerDuty account, visit our [Knowledge Base](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/apps)

#### What is an app?
An app allows customers to set up other web-enabled businesses to work with PagerDuty or to make PagerDuty more useful. Apps can send data to PagerDuty or receive data from PagerDuty.

#### What functionalities are available to apps?
[See an overview of app functionality](../../docs/app-integration-development/04-App-Functionality.md)

#### Which app functionality is right for me?
Use our [API Picker](../../docs/app-integration-development/05-API-Picker.md) resource to choose the app functionality that's right for your needs.

#### Who builds apps?
Apps are built by PagerDuty, our partners, our customers, system integrators, and the open source community! Any PagerDuty customer or developer with a [PagerDuty developer account](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/developer-account) has access to PagerDuty app development tools. Apps can be used on a single account or published for all PagerDuty users.
