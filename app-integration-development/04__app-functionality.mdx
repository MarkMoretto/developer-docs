### PagerDuty App Functionality


| App Functionality   | Description|
|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| <Link to="/docs/app-integration-development/events-integration/">Events Integration</Link> |  Send machine events **from** your tool **to** PagerDuty over our asynchronous <Link to="/docs/events-api-v2/overview/">Events API v2</Link>. This is the best way for monitoring tools to connect with PagerDuty in order to trigger incidents. |
| <Link to="/docs/app-integration-development/events-integration/#simple-install-flow-optional-but-recommended">Simple Install Flow</Link>|  If you're using Events Integration, your users can quickly connect to PagerDuty directly from your tool with the Simple Install Flow! [See Demo](https://acme.pagerduty.dev) |
| <Link to="/docs/app-integration-development/oauth-2-functionality/">OAuth 2.0</Link>|  Connect to our [REST API](https://api-reference.pagerduty.com/) as a PagerDuty user (not full account access) to administer PagerDuty or get data (create an on-call schedule, get a list of team members, etc). |

### More Ways To Connect With PagerDuty

These platform features are not available through PagerDuty's app configuration framework (yet!) but are still available for your app to use.

|REST API Token|If you need account-level access to a PagerDuty account, you can [request a token from PagerDuty admin users](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-rest-api-keys).|
|Webhooks|PagerDuty will send messages **to** your tool when certain activities occur. For example: incident triggered, note is added to an incident, etc). <br/><br/>There are 2 ways to create a webhook extension: <ul><li>Over the REST API with the [/extensions endpoint](https://api-reference.pagerduty.com/#!/Extensions/post_extensions) </li><li>[In the PagerDuty web interface](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/webhooks)</li></ul>|
