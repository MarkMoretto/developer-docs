        <strong>Trigger incidents in PagerDuty</strong> (machine events or signals)
        <br/><br/>
        If you're integrating a monitoring tool with PagerDuty, this is for you!

        Events API - <Link to="/docs/app-integration-development/events-integration/">Read this guide to publish an integration with us</Link> or get started on an internal integration.
        <br/><br/>
        The Events API is asynchronous, designed for high volume, and connected to PagerDuty Event Intelligence which does grouping, deduplication, and more to help reduce noise and speed up response times.

    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Trigger incidents in PagerDuty</strong> (human activity)
        <br/><br/>
        If a human action is required to trigger the incident (for instance: opening a ticket, clicking a button, typing a chat command), this is the best way to create an incident in PagerDuty.
      </td>
      <td>
        <a href="https://api-reference.pagerduty.com/#!/Incidents/post_incidents"> REST API - /incidents endpoint</a>
        <br/><br/>
        This endpoint is synchronous (you will receive a reference to the incident created in the response) and rate limited to 1 incident per second.
