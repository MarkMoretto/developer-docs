PagerDuty Webhooks provide client certificates when requested by a server (Mutual TLS).  

It is our recommendation that customers configure their servers to trust the root certificate listed below.  Customers choosing to rely on the PagerDuty leaf certificate are responsible for rotating to the <a href="#new-certificates">new certificate</a> at the appropriate time in order to avoid interrupted connectivity.
