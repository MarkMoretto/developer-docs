The PagerDuty Incident Creation API endpoint is part of <Link to="/docs/rest-api-v2/rest-api/">REST API v2</Link> and is usable by third parties. With this API, one can connect to a PagerDuty account and create or edit incidents on that account. This API is not to be used for connecting your monitoring tools to send events to PagerDuty; for that, use the <Link to="/docs/events-api-v2/overview/">Events APIs</Link>.

### What and Where

This API is designed around RESTful principles and conforms to the conventions of our other <Link to="/docs/rest-api-v2/endpoints/">RESTful API endpoints</Link>.

Unlike the Events APIs, the Incident Creation API is **heavily rate limited** on a per-account basis. It’s meant for the creation of events at "human speed" - in response to user action, rather than automated tooling.

This API is also **synchronous**, as it returns a fully-formed Incident object (rather than the incident key returned by the asynchronous Events APIs). The Events APIs accept arbitrary JSON objects, while the Incident creation API currently **only supports string Incident bodies**.

The Incident Creation API is analogous to clicking on the **Create Incident** button in PagerDuty’s web or mobile interfaces. It captures incident information from users and uses that to create a new incident, regardless of monitoring tool data.

The Incident Creation API can be used to create incidents on a service. In order to create an incident the user must pass a **type** ("incident"), **title**, and the affected **service**. Some request headers must also be specified with the request:

  * **Authorization**: All REST API calls require <Link to="/docs/rest-api-v2/authentication/">Authentication</Link>. In order to make successful requests to the API, you must provide a valid form of authorization.
  * **Content-Type:** `application/json`
  * **Accept**: `application/vnd.pagerduty+json;version=2`
  * **From**: The email address of a valid PagerDuty user on the account associated with the auth token.

### Making a Request

Incidents created with the Incident Creation API can be updated with the existing [Incidents API update calls](https://api-reference.pagerduty.com/#!/Incidents/post_incidents).

The Incident Creation API also accepts other optional parameters:

| Name | Description | To Note: |
|:-----|:------------|:---------|
| Body | Provides a detailed description of the incident, in addition to the summary provided in the title. | Details defined here will be included in the details of the web UI. |
| Incident Key | Similar to PagerDuty's Events APIs, the Incident Creation API allows you to pass a unique incident key to identify the incident. | If an incident exists on the provided service with the same incident key, a subsequent Incident Create request will be denied with a `400 Bad Request`. |
| Assignee | A list of users to assign to the incident. Cannot be provided if `escalation_policy` is already specified. Only one assignee is supported at this time. | When a user creates an incident assigned to themselves, the incident will be created in the [Acknowledged](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/glossary#section-acknowledged-incident) state and will not notify the user.If an incident is created without an assigned user or escalation policy, the default escalation policy for the service will be used. |
| Escalation Policy | Assign the incident to an escalation policy instead of assigning directly to a user. Cannot be provided if assignments are already specified. | When included, the escalation policy defined will override the escalation policy defined on the service. |
